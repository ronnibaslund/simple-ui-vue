# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on stabilizing the component library, fixing bugs, and improving the developer experience. We recently fixed an issue with the SimpleToggle component that was causing Vue runtime warnings when using the disabled prop in Histoire stories.

### Recent Changes
- Added the `disabled` prop to SimpleToggle component
- Fixed type issues with component sizes in several components
- Updated SimpleToggle's size classes to gracefully handle unknown size values

### Active Issues
1. Vue runtime warnings in Histoire stories for some components
2. Type inconsistencies between global type definitions and component implementations
3. Need to ensure all components follow the same patterns for props, events, and styling

## Current Component Status
The library contains multiple UI components, each at different stages of development:

- Form Components:
  - SimpleInput: stable
  - SimpleTextarea: stable
  - SimpleSelect: stable
  - SimpleToggle: recently fixed
  - SimpleRange: stable
  
- Layout Components:
  - SimpleModal: stable
  - SimpleAccordion: stable
  - SimpleTabs: stable
  
- Data Display:
  - SimpleDataTable: stable
  - SimpleProgress: stable
  
- Feedback Components:
  - SimpleAlert: stable
  - SimpleLoading: stable

## Ongoing Considerations
1. **Accessibility**: Ensuring all components meet WCAG guidelines
2. **Type Safety**: Maintaining consistent type definitions across the library
3. **Documentation**: Keeping Histoire stories up-to-date with component capabilities
4. **Testing**: Expanding test coverage for edge cases and new features

## Technical Decisions
1. Using computed properties for generating CSS classes based on props
2. Leveraging Vue's built-in reactivity for component state
3. Preferring composition API and `<script setup>` for better TypeScript integration
4. Following Vue 3's conventions for events with `defineEmits`

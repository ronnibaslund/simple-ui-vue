# Product Context

## Purpose
The Daisy UI Vue component library ("simple-daisy-vue") exists to provide developers with ready-to-use, customizable UI components that follow the DaisyUI design system while leveraging Vue 3's reactivity and composition API. This library bridges the gap between Tailwind CSS/DaisyUI's utility-first approach and the component-based architecture of Vue.

## Problems Solved
1. **Development Speed**: Reduce the time needed to build consistent UI interfaces with pre-built components
2. **Design Consistency**: Ensure UI elements follow consistent design patterns across applications
3. **Accessibility**: Bake accessibility best practices into components so developers don't have to implement them manually
4. **Customization**: Provide a balance between consistency and flexibility through props and theming
5. **Type Safety**: Offer TypeScript support to catch errors at compile time and improve developer experience

## User Experience Goals
- **Developer-friendly**: Components should have intuitive APIs that follow Vue's conventions
- **Customizable**: Allow theming and styling variations through props and CSS variables
- **Performant**: Components should be lightweight and not introduce performance bottlenecks
- **Accessible**: Follow WCAG guidelines for accessible interface elements
- **Responsive**: Components should work well across different screen sizes

## Target Users
The primary users are Vue developers building applications with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS who want to:
- Speed up their development process with pre-built components
- Ensure their UI is consistent and accessible
- Leverage Vue 3's features while maintaining a beautiful UI
- Have strong TypeScript support for better code quality

## User Stories
1. As a Vue developer, I want to quickly add styled UI components to my application so I can focus on business logic rather than styling.
2. As a product designer, I want consistency across UI elements so our application looks professional and cohesive.
3. As a developer, I want components that expose the right level of customization so I can adapt them to my specific needs.
4. As a team lead, I want my team to use a library with good documentation so they can be productive without extensive training.

# Project Brief: Daisy UI Vue Component Library

## Project Overview
Daisy is a Vue 3 component library based on DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS, providing a comprehensive set of UI components for building modern web applications. The library is built with TypeScript and is designed to be highly customizable, accessible, and easy to use.

## Core Requirements
1. **Component Library**: Create a collection of reusable Vue 3 components that follow DaisyUI design patterns
2. **Type Safety**: Ensure all components and utilities are fully typed with TypeScript
3. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation using VitePress
4. **Testing**: Unit test all components to ensure reliability
5. **Storybook/Histoire**: Showcase components in an interactive UI

## Key Goals
1. Create a cohesive design system with consistent API patterns across components
2. Provide excellent developer experience with strong TypeScript support
3. Ensure components are accessible and follow best practices
4. Allow for theming and customization of components
5. Maintain backward compatibility as the library evolves

## Technical Constraints
- Vue 3 Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for development and building
- Histoire for component documentation and showcase
- Vitest for unit testing

## Project Scope
The library includes UI components like buttons, inputs, toggles, modals, and more complex components like data tables, with a focus on creating a complete UI toolkit for modern web applications.

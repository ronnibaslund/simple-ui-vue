# Installation (Global Components)

This installation procedure **IS NOT** the recommended way of using this component library, but is the quickest way to get up and going and start playing around with SimpleDaisyVue.

It involves:

- importing a stylesheet generated by the library authors at build time and doesn't require Tailwind or Daisy UI installed in your current project (but NO tailwind classes will work except those already generated)
- Using a Vue Plugin to globally install all components at once

> [!WARNING]
> This **IS NOT** the recommended approach for installation.

## Step 1. Install the Core Library

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install simple-daisy-vue
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add simple-daisy-vue
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add simple-daisy-vue
```

:::

## Step 2. Register the Plugin and Styles

:::code-group

```ts [src/main.ts]
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

import { Plugin as SimpleDaisyVuePlugin } from 'simple-daisy-vue'

createApp(app).use(SimpleDaisyVuePlugin).mount('#app')
```

:::

## Step 3. Start Using the Components

:::code-group

```vue [App.vue]
<template>
  <SimpleAlert type="success"> Great! You've Successfully Installed DaisyVue </SimpleAlert>
</template>
```
